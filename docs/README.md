# Yet Another Trivia  

A simple flutter trivia application built using the [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/).  
If you're a flutter developer, you can work with the source code. Else (although I normally wouldn't suggest this), try the compiled versions below.

## Android  

If you know your stuff, choose from one of:

- [arm64-v8a](https://github.com/rohit-mp/yet-another-trivia/raw/deployment/output/app-arm64-v8a-release.apk)
- [armeabi-v7a](https://github.com/rohit-mp/yet-another-trivia/raw/deployment/output/app-armeabi-v7a-release.apk)
- [x86_64](https://github.com/rohit-mp/yet-another-trivia/raw/deployment/output/app-armeabi-v7a-release.apk)

Or you can just install [this](https://github.com/rohit-mp/yet-another-trivia/raw/deployment/output/app-release.apk).

## IOS  

Now before you say what's the point of using flutter, I wasn't able to procure access to a IOS device at the time to build and test my app on. So this remains a TODO for now.
